# Hytale Internals 
A comprehensive technical study and specification of the Hytale client. This project serves as the first attempt at documenting the inner workings of the NativeAOT compiled C# client and hopefully as the research layer for a future modding API.

## Goals
The primary objective of `hytale-internals` is to reconstruct the game's architecture and map the underlying structures. By doing so, the hope is to:
1. **Define a Formal Specification**
2. **Reverse Engineer the Runtime**
3. **Bridge to API**

## Repository Structure
* `/src` - The **MkDocs** source files (Research & Docs).

## Methodology
* **Static Analysis:** Conducted primarily via Ghidra.
* **Type Reconstruction:** Rebuilding C# class layouts from machine code.
* **No Assets:** This repository does not host game binaries, textures, or copyrighted assets.
