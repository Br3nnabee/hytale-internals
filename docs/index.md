# Introduction

Welcome to the **Hytale Internals** research project. 

Since the Hytale client uses .NET **NativeAOT** compilation, all code is collapsed into machine code. This means that most of the program becomes very difficult to read, with no metadata to guide our understanding. This project is dedicated to piecing all of the assembly code together into something that can be understood by developers.
